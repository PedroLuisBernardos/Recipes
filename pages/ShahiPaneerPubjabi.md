## Instructions

### Prep

1. Soak the <samp>cashew nuts</samp> in hot water for 15-20 minutes.
1. Warm up the <samp>heavy cream</samp> in the microwave for a few seconds. Take few <samp>saffron strands</samp>, crush and add to the warm cream. Mix and keep it aside.
1. Now take onion paste ingredients <samp>(onion, ginger, garlic, green chili, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon and cardamoms, and water)</samp> in a saucepan. Turn the heat on medium. Let it cook for 8-10 minutes or till the onions become soft. Let it cool down.
1. Now make three kinds of purÃ©es in the following order: **First**, make <samp>cashew paste</samp>. **Then** grind cooked <samp>onion</samp> into a fine paste and then grind roughly chopped <samp>tomatoes</samp> into a puree.

### Cooking

1. Heat the <samp>ghee</samp> in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, **sieve** and add the prepared <samp>onion paste</samp>. Cook with stirring occasionally till it comes thick. It may take around 5-6 minutes.
1. Now add the <samp>tomato puree</samp> and <samp>salt</samp>. Mix, cook till all the moisture evaporated and it becomes a thick paste. So stir in between and make sure that it is not sticking to the sides and bottom of the pan. If it is spluttering too much then you can partially cover the pan.
1. Now add the <samp>red chili powder</samp>, <samp>coriander powder</samp> and <samp>turmeric powder</samp>. Mix well and cook for a minute.
1. Now mix in the <samp>cashew paste</samp>, <samp>water</samp>, and <samp>sugar</samp>. Simmer for 5-6 minutes. Do stir in between.
1. Now add <samp>garam masala</samp> and <samp>kasoori methi</samp> (crushed between your palm). Mix well.
1. Add paneer cubes. Mix and simmer for 1-2 minutes.
1. Now add <samp>saffron-cream mixture</samp>. Mix and let it come to a simmer.
1. Lastly, add <samp>cardamom powder</samp> and turn off the stove.
1. Stir well and <samp>shahi paneer</samp>.
1. Garnish it with the remaining Kasuri methi, and fresh cream and coriander leaves.

### Notes

* Cardamom powder must be added at the end of the cooking process. After adding, do not boil or simmer the gravy otherwise it loses its aroma.
* You should not simmer for longer after adding paneer pieces. Otherwise, paneer will get chewy.
* Always crush kasoori methi between your palm before adding. By doing so, it releases its flavor at most. Sometimes, kasoori methi catches up moisture (if living in a humid climate) and you cannot crush into powder. In that case, toast it into the microwave for 45 seconds. Let cool down and then crush.
