            <li>2 onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>100g gram flour</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp gluten-free baking powder</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1 green chilli, deseeded and very finely chopped</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>

            <li>Soak the onion in cold water while you make the base mix. Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl, then add the chilli powder, turmeric, chopped chilli and a good sprinkling of salt. Mix in about 100ml of cold water to make a thick batter - add a splash more if it feels too stiff.</li>
            <li>Drain the onion well and mix it into the batter. Heat about 5cm of oil in a wok or deep pan. Do not fill the pan more than a third full. Add a tiny speck of batter. If it rises to the surface surrounded by bubbles and starts to brown, then the oil is hot enough for frying.</li>
            <li>Lower heaped tbsps of the bhaji mixture into the pan, a few at a time, and cook for a few mins, turning once, until they are evenly browned and crisp, so about 3-4 mins. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with a little salt and keep warm while you cook the rest. </li>
